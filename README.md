# Lesson 2 - Introduction to Abstraction using Variables

## Setup

Clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/FRC-Processing-Lessons/Lesson_2_Intro_Abstractions.git`

Navigate to your repository folder, and open the following file in Processing:

`Lesson_2_Intro_Abstractions.pde`

In case you can't find processing, make sure that after unarchiving the application, setup shortcuts for the executable file.

## Series Overview
This is the first of a series of lessons on programming in Java for the FIRST Robotics Competition.  It is designed for novice programmers, and can act as a precursor programming sequence to learning FRC-Java.  We will introduce:

1. Data abstraction
2. Procedure definitions
3. Procedure invocations
4. Looped behavior
5. Field scope
6. Class definitions
7. Object instantiations
8. Instance methods
9. Static methods

This series will be taught using the Processing framework for easy visualization.

## Lesson Overview

Once the repository is cloned and the file is open in Processing, students should see 9 TODOs listed. Throughout the course of this lesson, students...

1. Declare and initialize global variables.
   - Should know what a variable is in the context of programming.
   - Should know what the difference between declaration and initalization.
   - (OPTIONAL) Should know where a global variable is declared and initialized.
2. Use global variables to change parameters passed into a standard canvas shape method.
   - Change the size of a rectangle
   - Change the position of rectangle 
3. Use global variables to dynamically change the position of a shape.
   - Assign different values to a variable beyond initialization.
   - Determine code ordering in order to facilitate canvas clearing.
